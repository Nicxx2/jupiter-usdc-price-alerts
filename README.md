# 🚀 Jupiter USDC Price Alerts v2.2.1

A real-time, web-enabled price alert tool for Solana tokens using the **Jupiter Aggregator**.

Track simulated USDC swaps with real price impact and receive instant alerts via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) — now with a **modern Web UI**!


---

## ✨ What's New in v2.2

### 📱 Mobile Layout Tweaks
- Improved layout so the UI now looks better on phones and smaller screens.

### 💼 Wallet Information Panel
- You can now add wallets to view real-time holdings and cost basis.
- A new **“All”** option shows the combined totals across all wallets.
- Requires: `SOLANATRACKER_API_KEY` and that you set `WALLET_ADDRESSES` with at least one wallet address.

## v2.1

### 🔍 RSI Indicators (Optional)
By providing a `SOLANATRACKER_API_KEY`, you enable a new RSI panel in the UI that lets you:

- **RSI is calculated on the token’s USD (USDC) price**, not on the token/SOL pair
- View live RSI values across multiple intervals: `1s`, `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `4h`
- Set **RSI alert thresholds**, e.g. `"below:30"`, `"above:70"`
- Optionally **auto-reset alerts** when RSI crosses back (toggle with `RSI_RESET_ENABLED`)


> 📝 To use RSI features, create a free account at [solanatracker.io](https://www.solanatracker.io/) and generate an API key  
> 🚦 Free API keys include **10,000 requests per month**

### 🛡️ Resilience to API Hiccups
- Handles rate limits (`429`) and timeouts gracefully
- If RSI data is unavailable, the UI displays `"––"` instead of crashing
- RSI alerts automatically resume on the next scheduled check

### 🖥️ RSI Alert Status Badges
- New badges show live RSI alert state:
  - 🟢 **Active**
  - 🟡 **Waiting to Reactivate**
  - 🔴 **Inactive**



---

- 🌐 **Live Web UI** — View current swap prices, price history, and your alert thresholds  
- 🧠 **On-the-fly updates** — Adjust USD amount, buy/sell targets, and more  
- 📈 **Chart View** — Visualize price trends and alert triggers over time  
- 🐳 **Single container build** — Backend + Web + Alert engine bundled together

## 🐳 Docker Compose Example

Paste the following into a `docker-compose.yml` file.

✅ Update the `OUTPUT_MINT` to the token you want to monitor (e.g. BONK, JIM, PEPE).  
🕒 Make sure to change the `TZ` (timezone) to match **your region** — this helps timestamps and cooldown logic align properly.

## 🌐 Accessing the Web UI

Once the container is running, you can view and control everything from a clean browser interface.

### ✅ How to Access

If you're running this locally:

`http://localhost:8000`



If running on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the IP address or hostname of your server:

`http://<your-server-ip>:8000`



You’ll be able to:

- View real-time buy/sell prices
- Add/remove alert thresholds on the fly
- Change the simulated USD amount
- See when each alert was triggered
- Watch charted price history with trigger lines
- (Optional) Set the SOLANATRACKER_API_KEY env var to enable a live 14-period USD-based RSI panel and “above:/below:” threshold alerts in the UI. If you omit the key, the RSI cards stay disabled (showing “—”).
- (Optional) View token holdings and cost basis for one or more wallets (with optional aggregation) using the SOLANATRACKER_API_KEY — requires setting `WALLET_ADDRESSES` with at least one wallet address.
